### whoami

Hi, my name is Paul (obviously) and I'm a husband, father and computer programmer.

I met my beautiful wife, Charlene, back when we were in high school and
have been together ever since. Somewhere along the way the ducks got in a row;
we bought a house, got married and started our own family. 

While all this was happening, I began my career as a software developer,
scoring a job at a [MicroISV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microisv) working on a popular 
[build automation tool](http://www.finalbuilder.com). After seven years, 
I decided it was time to move on, and got a job at the Australian Building Codes Board, 
where I'm currently employed.

When I'm not working, or spending time with my family, I enjoy hacking away
on [some project](/programming/), or working on my car.

### about this site

This site came about after a mate was explaining his new Node 
[project](https://github.com/benrhughes/crashdown) to me, and I thought that it'd 
be an interesting exercise to do something similiar in [Go](http://golang.org). 
So after a couple of hours I had a basic version up and running and figured
I may as well put it to use. 

It is currently hosted on a Raspberry Pi via my home broadband connection, so if 
it happens to be down when you try to visit, just try again later.
