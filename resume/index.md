### Overview

I am a passionate software developer with 8 years commercial experience writing applications for Windows, Linux and the web.

I am a strong advocate of self-education and believe in continuously pushing myself to learn new ideas and concepts, but also value looking back and understanding the work that has come before.

I take pride in writing code that is clean, simple &mdash; elegant, but also pragmatic.

### Area of Interest

#### Functional Programming

Side-effect based programming, such as object orientation, leads the systems we design to be overly complex. As the volume and scope of software increases, we are losing the ability to reason about the code that we write. I believe that functional programming allows us to construct solutions to complex problems out of components that we can reason about, and is where we, as an industry, need to focus.

Working in Clojure, while not a pure functional language, has given me experience writing in a functional style. I wish to continue my journey into the world of functional programming and truly master a pure functional language, such as Haskell.
