## Résumé

Passionate software developer with 8 years commercial experience writing Windows, Linux and web applications.

Strong advocate of self-education; that we should be continuously pushing ourselves to learn new ideas and concepts, but also looking back and understanding the work that has been done before us.

Take pride in writing code that is clean, simple &mdash; elegant, but also be pragmatic and understand that sometimes there are trade-offs that need to be made.

### Area of Interest

#### Functional Programming

The current status quo of programming with side-effects, is causing the systems we design to be overly complex and because of this, we are loosing our ability to reason about the code we write. It is with this fact, that I believe functional programming is where we, as an industry, need to be focusing in order to improve the quality of the systems we build.

Up until recently I have focused on writing code in Clojure, while not a pure functional language, has given me experience writing in a functional style. It is with this experience, that I wish to continue my journey into the world of functional programming and truly master a pure functional language, such as Haskell.
