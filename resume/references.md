Paul is one of the most talented software engineers I've worked with in my 12 years in the industry. He is thorough, passionate and can view problems at multiple levels of abstraction.

What sets Paul apart from most developers though is his ability to produce simple solutions to complex problems. He has an enviable intuition for seeing when and how a solution can be simplified, and the tenacity and skill to see it through. This simplicity makes his code and the systems he designs remarkably easy to understand.

Although he is often the smartest person in the room, Paul is always humble, willing to learn and willing to teach. Despite his technical skill, he is very pragmatic and never loses sight of the broader purpose of his work.
